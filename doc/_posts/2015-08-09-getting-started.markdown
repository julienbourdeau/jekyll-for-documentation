This theme has been made for documentation. There is no latest posts page, no publishing date, no author and such things.

### Directory structure

There is no `_posts` folder at the root of the project (unlike the default setup of Jekyll). We
use folder as category and they will show in the sidebar.

For example, this directory structure will generate the following sidebar.
