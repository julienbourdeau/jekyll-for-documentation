If you are using Jekyll, there is a pretty big chance you want to host it on GitHub with GitHub Pages.

The page you are looking at is hosted by GitHub so it is possible. But still, few features described here
won't work with GitHub because they are base on plugins.

If you want to build your site like GitHub will, run `bundle exec jekyll build --safe`.
